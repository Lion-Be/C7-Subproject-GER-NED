# The bill that never was: Recovering counterfactual laws under opposition preferences
## :star: Purpose 

How would government bills look like if opposition demands would be incorporated in the legislative process?

Drafting of new bills is the prerogative of the government. After a proposal for a new law has been drafted, members of parliament discuss, scrutinize and adapt bill proposals by **submitting amendments to government legislation**. Since coalition parties hold the majority of the seats in parliament, the opposition is usually left out as a bystander. Opposition parties regularly intensively re-work proposed legislation, but their amendment proposals are usually voted down in parliament. 

As political observers, we almost **never see how government laws would look like if opposition demands would be incorporated** because these **counterfactual bills don't come to light.** 

**Goal:** In this project, we recover these counterfactual bills using a natural language processing pipeline in R.
